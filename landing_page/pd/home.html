                    </h4>

                    <p>
                        Savvly is a new way for anyone, in any income bracket, to protect and increase their
                        retirement savings without changing the amount they save today.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Knowing how much to save for retirement is a huge challenge for almost everyone, and for some,
                        it is critical. Statistics tell us that 2 of 3 Americans will not have enough to get them
                        through retirement.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        On top of that, longer life expectancies make the risk of running out of money even greater.

                            Savvly solves the problem of not having enough for retirement. It does this by creating a
                            new type of savings pool. This new type of pool protects customers from running out of
                            money. <br><br>It does this by replenishing customers’ retirement funds, which means they
                            can live
                            and spend with peace of mind.

            <p>
                Savvly protects its clients by giving them more money as they get older. Savvly participants
                don't worry about running out of money. They know more money will be there when they need it the
                most.
            </p>

            <p>
                Savvly's customers choose the ideal age they want to receive their Savvly payout. They decide
                when they want to replenish their retirement account. They get the peace of mind they deserve.

                    <p>
                        Some clients may feel unsure about what payout age to select. Statistics show that many
                        retirees would do well with a payout age of 85-86. And allocating 5-10% of their assets in
                        Savvly is the recommended amount for most people. Savvly’s artificial intelligence—aka The
                        Savvly Optimizer—helps people make the perfect investment choices based on their specific
                        personal situation and goals. Clients can visualize how their decisions will impact their
                        financial future. <a href="javascript:void(0)" style="color:#016e78"> <b> Try the Savvly Optimizer

                Savvly’s Clients Control Their Future
            </h5>

            <p>
                Savvly users get to determine both their payoff amount and the date of the lump sum payment. The
                further they push out their payout date, the larger their payout will be. This level of control
                gives the Savvly user peace of mind. Each client knows they can replenish their retirement savings
                account at a time they choose. This both enhances their quality of life and allows them to spend
                more in their early retirement.
            </p>

            <h5>
                Savvly Means No Minimum Investment, No Commitments, 100% Transparency
            </h5>

            <p>
                There is no minimum investment—members can invest as little as $10 or more than $100,000.
            </p>

            <p>
                No commitments: choose monthly installments or one-time deposits at your convenience, whichever best
                fits your situation. Users can also redirect funds from their existing retirement accounts (401k, IRA,
                etc.). Contributions can be qualified or non-qualified.
            </p>

            <p>
                Clients always have access to their investments within the first two years. Of course, this is the part
                of their retirement funds they will not want to touch.
            </p>

            <p>
                Savvly’s users always have 24/7 access to their accounts and can always see how they are doing and how
                much to expect at payout. Even if they only invested $10.

                    Act. Congress signed it into law to help Americans save enough for the last years of retirement.

                <p>
                    Savvly is not like an insurance company that takes your money and invests it on your behalf. If an
                    insurance company goes out of business, you may lose all your money, as nearly happened in
                    2008–2009. But with Savvly, independent custodians hold your assets. Even if Savvly goes away, your
                    investment remains secure and protected because Savvly has no investment exposure.

                        The graph to the right shows the results of having started with Savvly in 1980 at age 50. The
                        investor
                        chooses the S&P 500 for their Savvly fund allocation. The green line is the actual return made
                        on the S&P 500. The red line is how Savvly would have performed.

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        An investment in Savvly made in 1980 would have brought almost three times the typical return at
                        85 years of age.
                        It is the same amount of money
                        in the same fund, yet Savvly would have performed two to three times better than the market.
                        This is because clients’ assets are pooled together, unlike what typically occurs with insurance
                        products, and because Savvly eliminates typical industry profiteering.

                        invested in the S&P 500 BUT through the Savvly platform would have returned about $350 today.
                        Savvly
                        can take any investment and make it return 2 to 4 times more.

            <p>
                Savvly customers choose where their funds get invested. We provide a selection of the safest and most
                reputable low-cost funds. And we invest with rock-solid investment houses like Fidelity, Vanguard, and
                BlackRock. For these reasons, Savvly users get the benefit of safe, long-term investments. AND they get
                the double (or even triple or quadruple) return generated by Savvly's unique approach.

            <p>
                Savvly’s new way of pooling takes a portion of the money the client was going to invest anyway but
                generates returns that are two to three times better than the market. This is a massive win for all
                Americans facing down retirement.

                <h5>
                    Annuities Get a Bad Rap for a Good Reason
                </h5>

                <p>
                    Annuities are expensive and complex products sold by insurance companies. They are sold as a way to
                    provide a steady income, a type of "protection." But that protection comes at a cost. Buyers pay
                    high fees for annuities, and they will lose out on returns that could have been better. An annuity’s
                    fixed or variable return may be much lower than the return of a diversified portfolio of stocks and
                    bonds. And, because annuity payouts are low and unchanging, they are unlikely to protect consumers
                    against inflation.
                </p>

                <p>
                    After the financial crisis of 2008, annuities became even less valuable. Since then, the insurance
                    industry has changed to protect itself by providing limited benefits to clients. Because of this,
                    many financial advisors continue to advise against purchasing annuities.

                            Savvly Is an Efficient Alternative to Annuities
                        </h5>

                        <p>
                            Savvly can be a part of any 401K, and it offers much better returns than an annuity. Clients
                            keep their gains and protect their futures. The illustration on the left, courtesy of Fisher
                            Investments, shows the impact of fees on long-term investments in annuities.
                        </p>

                        <p>

                            The net investment return goes down by almost half throughout the annuity contract. That is
                            a catastrophic result. On the other hand, Savvly increases the value of your investment.

                        <p>
                            In the illustration on the right, we compare Savvly against a range of annuities. Consider
                            this
                            70-year-old man. He invests 10% of his one Million dollar portfolio into both a 15-year
                            deferred annuity and into the Savvly platform. Once he reaches 85, the annuity will provide
                            him with $1,600 to $2,300 per month.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The payment will only continue as long as he is alive.
                            When he dies, there is nothing to transfer to his heirs. In both cases (with the annuity and
                            Savvly), if he passes away before reaching 85, he forfeits his initial $100,000 investment.

                            be $280,000.
                            If the market performed in a more historically likely way, say 8%, he would get a lump-sum

                <p>
                    Our users don’t have to save more to enjoy more money for retirement. They only need to put a small
                    part of their savings into Savvly.
                    Savvly recommends a maximum of 10% of their retirement savings or contributions.

                <p>
                    Their money will stay in safe, low-cost funds. We place their assets in funds they select (low-cost
                    S&P500 index funds, target-date funds...).
                    Often their investment remains in the same fund they were already in since Savvly only offers the
                    most common funds available.

                                    When clients join Savvly, they decide on a specific payout age. They commit to
                                    leaving their
                                    money in
                                    their investment until that age.

                        <p>
                            When they reach that age, they receive a lump sum payment. If they don’t make it to that
                            age, the money reverts to the pool. Savvly is the sharing network for retirement.

                <p>
                    Savvly is available in employers’ 401ks and other retirement plans. Employees can transfer their
                    contributions into Savvly just like any other fund. They just select the percentage of the amount of
                    money to transfer. Savvly works with a Roth 401K or a standard 401K and both qualified and
                    non-qualified contributions.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If an employer's 401K plan does not yet include Savvly, we can add it. Savvly can integrate with
                    most recordkeeping platforms.
                </p>

                        Moving your savings into a Savvly account works like investing in any other fund.
                    </b>

                <ul class="benefitsNumbers">
                    <li>The employee chooses a percentage or amount of contribution to transfer to Savvly. </li>
                    <li>They then select their payout age on the Savvly app or website. </li>

                <p>
                    Savvly's state-of-the-art platform includes an artificial intelligence optimizer to help clients
                    select their optimal payout age based on their specific situation. It looks at things like how much
                    money they have, their risk appetite, etc.

                    Love Savvly</h4>

                <h5>
                    Savvly Meets the Strict Expectations of Administrators and HR Managers
                </h5>

                <p>
                    Clients have two years to select their payout ages after signing up with the Savvly application or
                    contributing to Savvly through their employer. In the meantime, Savvly will automatically assign an
                    investment fund and a payout age.
                </p>

                <p>
                    For most people, the recommended payout age is between 84 and 86. Savvly offers low-cost funds that
                    match the performance of the S&P500 index and other well-known funds that have specific target ages.
                    Clients can change their allocation when they log in to their Savvly account.
                </p>

                <p>
                    All Savvly customers have a two-year window to make adjustments. During that time, if they want,
                    they can transfer their savings out of Savvly—at no cost to them. After two years, their payout age
                    locks in, and they can no longer withdraw money from Savvly. They can, of course, continue to add to
                    their account at any time.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In the first two years, Savvly will be in touch with its clients multiple times. Savvly will ensure
                    that clients understand the implications of a long-term investment that loses liquidity after two
                    years.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This process eliminates the liability of Savvly’s distribution channels (e.g., employer 401K plans).
                    Clients that agree to maintain their funds in Savvly after the initial two-year period will have
                    been well-informed about the implications of their decisions. Our process will document their
                    decisions, thereby eliminating employer liability.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Savvly will return the client's funds if they do not confirm a payout age and investment allocation
                    within two years. This safety measure guarantees the client's satisfaction.

                            Considering the safety measures that Savvly has implemented, we are currently working to
                            make it a QDIA
                            option. Employers will be able to select Savvly as a standard investment option for
                            employees who do not
                            choose a specific investment allocation.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In that scenario, the investment in Savvly would be less than 10% of the employee’s overall
                            contribution.

                    Unlike other long-term investment alternatives, Savvly is a safe option for plan sponsors.
                    Participants can move money out of Savvly at their discretion within two years at no cost.

                        <p>
                            Savvly is user-friendly and fee-friendly as well. Many investment vehicles have hefty hidden
                            fees that eat away at your returns. Savvly has some of the lowest expense ratios in the
                            industry.
                            The chart below shows our current pricing. Our management fees are as low as 0.25% per year.
                            These are among the lowest in the industry.

                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Long-term investment products like annuities and mutual funds are often ten to twenty times
                            higher than that. As shown already on the chart above courtesy of Fisher Investments, the
                            compounding effect of these high fees
                            significantly reduces your return on investment.
