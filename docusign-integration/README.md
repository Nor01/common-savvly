# DocuSign Integration

# Purpose

The DocuSign Integration is a cron service which kicks off periodically to check for clients requiring e-signature. If any clients are found, the service will formulate and send a request for e-signature via email. 


# TODO:

* Rotate DocuSign keys and move to secret manager
